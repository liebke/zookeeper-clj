(ns zookeeper
  "
    Zookeeper-clj is a Clojure DSL for <a href=\"http://zookeeper.apache.org/\">Apache ZooKeeper</a>, which \"<i>is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services.</i>\"

Out of the box ZooKeeper provides name service, configuration, and group membership. From these core services, higher-level distributed concurrency abstractions can be built, including distributed locks, distributed queues, barriers, leader-election, and transaction services as described in <a href=\"http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/recipes.html\">ZooKeeper Recipes and Solutions</a> and the paper <a href=\"http://www.usenix.org/event/atc10/tech/full_papers/Hunt.pdf\">\"ZooKeeper: Wait-free coordination for Internet-scale systems\"</a>.
